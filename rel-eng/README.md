OpenShift Origin "Next" (v3) Packaging

Workspace for collaborating on Next-Gen OpenShift Origin Packaging needs.

Builds
------
Builds for the mean time will happen in this copr: [origin-next](http://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/maxamillion/origin-next/)

When the dust settles and things stabilize, this should be submitted to Fedora proper.
